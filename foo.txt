So I go down the streets,
down to my good friend's house.
I said "Look man I'm outdoors you know.
Can I stay with you maybe a couple days?"
He said "Uh, Let me go and ask my wife"
He come out of the house.
I could see in his face.
I know that was no.
He said, "I don't know man, ah she kinda funny, you know."
I said, "I know, everybody funny. Now you funny too."
